# CertPri
We propose CertPri, a test input prioritization technique designed based on a movement cost perspective of test inputs in DNNsâ€™ feature space. 
CertPri differs from previous works in three key aspects:
(1) certifiable - it provides formal robustness guarantee for the movement cost; 
(2) effective - it leverages formal guaranteed movement costs to identify malicious bug-revealing test inputs; and 
(3) generic - it can be applied to various tasks, data forms, models, and scenarios. 
CertPri significantly improves 53.97% prioritization effectiveness on average compared with baselines. 
Besides, its robustness and generalizability are 1.41-2.00 times and 1.33-3.39 times that of baselines on average, respectively.
